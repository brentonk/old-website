          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> When an outside power
          gains control of a piece of territory, such as in a colonial
          endeavor or a military occupation, it inherits the burden of
          managing internal conflict among the groups already residing
          there. Using a formal model, this paper develops a new theory of how
          the policies of an extractive outside force affect the occurrence of
          internal social conflict, and vice versa. When an outside ruler
          confronts a highly fractionalized society, the most profitable
          policy is one that maximizes internal conflict and minimizes
          resistance against external rule. However, the broader analysis does
          not lend support to the conventional wisdom of "divide and rule."
          All else equal, a ruler would rather govern a unified society than a
          divided one, as internal conflict is economically
          destructive.</p>

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> I provide a set of methods to estimate
          logistic regression coefficients when there is nonignorable
          missingness or measurement error in the outcome variable. Instead of
          requiring knowledge of the process by which the data went missing,
          these methods estimate bounds on the set of results that could be
          obtained under any assumption about the source of missingness. This
          approach is conservative by design, allowing analysts to discover
          exactly what kinds of results are&mdash;and are not&mdash;consistent
          with their data, given the uncertainty induced by
          missingness. Unlike existing approaches to nonignorable missing
          data, the estimators presented in this paper do not depend on
          untestable assumptions, nor do they require application-specific
          programming. I use simulations to illustrate which applied settings
          are most favorable to each of the three methods that I develop. I
          apply the methods to data from two previous
          studies, <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/3013934">Oneal and
          Russett's (1997)</a> analysis of the liberal peace

          robustness of their results against potential miscoding of

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> I study the problems of diplomatic
          communication between states that have a common purpose, such as in
          a joint military effort. I analyze a formal model to characterize
          the conditions under which a state can credibly reveal private
          information to its ally. On one hand, the joint effort is more
          likely to be successful if the allies are fully informed about the
          international environment. On the other hand, each individual state
          would prefer to free-ride on its partners' efforts, all else
          equal. A state therefore may have an incentive to conceal
          information from its ally, if revealing such information would cause
          the ally to contribute less. Using a formal model, I characterize
          what kinds of topics states can (and cannot) credibly communicate
          about with their allies. No informative communication is possible
          when the source of uncertainty is a state's valuation of the issue
          at stake. In this case, a state prefers to pretend to be relatively
          unwilling to participate, so as to induce greater contributions by
          its partners. A similar result holds when one state has private
          knowledge of the common enemy's strength. However, when there are
          multiple ways to contribute, a state can credibly reveal information
          about its comparative advantage.</p>

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> How do flexibility and the other
          attributes of the bargaining process affect the resolution of
          international crises?  We use Bayesian mechanism design to
          investigate the relationship between the wide variety of possible
          negotiation protocols and the equilibrium outcomes of crises.  Our
          main conclusion is that although there is seemingly endless
          complexity in the possible forms that negotiations can take, there
          is a very simple structure to the possible outcomes that can emerge
          from negotiations. More precisely, we show that any outcome of a
          complex negotiation procedure could also be attained by a simple
          take-it-or-leave-it offer. In this sense, the great diversity of
          potential bargaining structures is an illusion. Our results cast
          doubt on the common supposition that a state is better off using a
          flexible bargaining strategy than an inflexible one. In an
          empirical analysis of international crises, we find that the
          issuance of an ultimatum has no discernible effect on the result of
          a crisis, in line with our theoretical predictions.</p>

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> I develop a model of electoral
          competition in which candidates' ability to raise money is related
          to their private information about the policy they will implement if
          elected. I use the model to analyze how politicians' fundraising
          decisions are affected by concerns about signaling their policy
          intentions, and to query whether campaign finance reform can reduce
          the possibility of electing well-funded candidates with policy
          intentions far from the median voter. I find that if centrist
          candidates can raise money more easily than others, they always
          exploit this advantage in equilibrium, using high spending as a
          signal of their proximity to the median voter. The reverse is not
          true when non-centrists have the fundraising advantage. In this
          case, candidates who spend highly are perceived as having extreme
          policy intentions, offsetting the otherwise positive electoral
          effect of spending. The electoral consequences of campaign finance
          reform are also asymmetric. When non-centrists can raise money more
          easily, a marginal decrease in the size of their advantage may
          increase the chance that a centrist is elected; however, in the
          reverse case, such measures have no effect on the chance of electing
          a non-centrist.</p>

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We introduce a new statistical model
          to estimate the shape of potentially nonlinear, multivariate
          relationships. The method is built on basis regression, in which
          simple functions like polynomials are combined to approximate more
          complex relationships. To reduce the instability typically
          associated with basis regression, we use penalized regression
          techniques that perform automatic model selection, eliminating many
          terms from the final estimate. We focus on methods that satisfy the
          oracle property, which guarantees that terms with no true effect on
          the outcome are excluded from the estimated model in sufficiently
          large samples. Finally, we calculate standard errors and other
          estimates of variability via the bootstrap. In a series of
          simulations, we show that our method can accurately estimate
          nonlinear relationships, even if the exact functional form is not
          known in advance. We apply our method to Gartzke's (2007) data on
          the "capitalist peace" and find that joint democracy and trade
          dependence may increase the chance of conflict in some cases,
          contrary to the original results.</p>

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The standard practice when estimating
          a treatment effect is to include all available pre-treatment
          variables in the propensity score, and we demonstrate that this
          approach is not always optimal when the goal is bias reduction. We
          characterize the conditions under which including an additional
          relevant variable in the propensity score increases the bias on the
          effect of interest across a variety of different implementations of
          the propensity score methodology. Moreover, we find that balance
          tests and sensitivity analysis provide limited protection against
          overadjustment.</p>
