# R Packages

I am the maintainer of the following R packages:

  * [`games`](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/games/index.html)
    (coauthored with Curt Signorino), which contains functions to estimate and
    analyze models of interdependent strategic behavior.  The functionality of
    the package is described and illustrated in detail in our *Journal of
    Statistical Software* article
    ["Estimation of Extensive Form Games in R"](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v56/i08).
    The package source is hosted
    [on GitHub](https://github.com/brentonk/games).

  * [`polywog`](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/polywog/index.html)
    (coauthored with Curt Signorino), which allows users to estimate
    relationships of unknown functional form using bootstrapped basis
    regression.  The package also provides routines to plot fitted values and
    marginal effects from fitted models.  The software and the underlying
    statistical techniques are described in our working paper
    ["Bootstrapped Basis Regression with Variable Selection: A New Method for Flexible Functional Form Estimation"](data/basics.pdf).
    The package source is hosted
    [on GitHub](https://github.com/brentonk/polywog).

  * [`pbivnorm`](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pbivnorm/index.html),
    which provides a vectorized function to compute the bivariate normal CDF.
    `pbivnorm` is based on code from the
    [`mnormt` package](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mnormt/index.html).
    The `pbivnorm` package source is hosted
    [on GitHub](https://github.com/brentonk/pbivnorm).
