    This paper uses a formal model to develop a theory of the relationship
    between social conflict within a piece of territory and the policies of an
    extractive outside force (e.g., a military occupier or colonial power).
    The results of the analysis run counter to the traditional notion of
    "divide and rule."

    When an outside power gains control of a piece of territory, such as in a
    colonial endeavor or a military occupation, it inherits the burden of
    managing internal conflict among the groups already residing there.  Using
    a formal model, this paper develops a new theory of how the policies of an
    extractive outside force affect the occurrence of internal social
    conflict, and vice versa.  When an outside ruler confronts a highly
    fractionalized society, the most profitable policy is one that maximizes
    internal conflict and minimizes resistance against external rule.
    However, the broader analysis does not lend support to the conventional
    wisdom of "divide and rule."  All else equal, a ruler would rather govern
    a unified society than a divided one, as internal conflict is economically
    destructive.  Similarly, I find that an outside force has no incentive to
    create artificial inequality between identical social groups.  The results
    of the model also suggest that harsh extractive policies and violent
    resistance may be more likely to occur when insurgents are concentrated in
    a few groups than when they have a broad base.  In extensions to the
    model, I show that natural resource wealth is less valuable than it might
    appear, and that productive investment can reduce commitment problems that
    otherwise lead to inefficiently high levels of appropriation.

    This paper develops a set of methods to estimate logistic regression
    coefficients when there is nonignorable missingness or measurement error
    in the outcome variable, as is common in empirical conflict research.
    Unlike common approaches to missing outcomes, these estimators do not
    depend on untestable assumptions or require application-specific
    programming.

    I provide a set of methods to estimate logistic regression coefficients
    when there is nonignorable missingness or measurement error in the outcome
    variable. Instead of requiring knowledge of the process by which the data
    went missing, these methods estimate bounds on the set of results that
    could be obtained under any assumption about the source of
    missingness. This approach is conservative by design, allowing analysts to
    discover exactly what kinds of results are---and are
    not---consistent with their data, given the uncertainty induced by
    missingness. Unlike existing approaches to nonignorable missing data, the
    estimators presented in this paper do not depend on untestable
    assumptions, nor do they require application-specific programming. I use
    simulations to illustrate which applied settings are most favorable to
    each of the three methods that I develop. I apply the methods to data from
    two previous studies, [Oneal and Russett's
    (1997)](http://www.jstor.org/stable/3013934) analysis of the liberal peace
    and [Lyall's
    (2010)](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=7093156)
    analysis of counterinsurgency success, to examine the robustness of their
    results against potential miscoding of outcomes.

    What kinds of information can allied countries credibly reveal to each
    other?  In a formal analysis of communication in a public goods dilemma, I
    find that the participants never reveal information about their
    willingness to contribute.  Moreover, sharing of intelligence about a
    common enemy can occur only under restrictive conditions.  However, the
    allies may be able to reveal their comparative advantage among potential
    avenues of contribution.

    I study the problems of diplomatic communication between states that have
    a common purpose, such as in a joint military effort.  I analyze a formal
    model to characterize the conditions under which a state can credibly
    reveal private information to its ally.  The results call into question
    the supposition that alliances play a general information-sharing role.
    No informative communication is possible when the states' private
    information concerns their cost of contributing to the project or,
    equivalently, their willingness to contribute.  In this case, states have
    an incentive to pretend to be relatively unwilling to participate, so as
    to induce greater contributions by their partners.  Similarly, when the
    source of private information is intelligence about how much effort will
    be required for the joint project to succeed, communication is possible
    only under highly restrictive conditions.  On the other hand,
    communication is broadly possible if there are multiple avenues of
    contribution (e.g., ground and air power) and states have private
    information about their specialty.

    How do flexibility and the other attributes of the bargaining process
    affect the resolution of international crises?  We show that any outcome
    of a complex negotiation procedure could also be attained by a simple
    take-it-or-leave-it offer. Our results cast doubt on the common
    supposition that a state is better off using a flexible bargaining
    strategy than an inflexible one.

    How do flexibility and the other attributes of the bargaining process
    affect the resolution of international crises?  We use Bayesian mechanism
    design to investigate the relationship between the wide variety of
    possible negotiation protocols and the equilibrium outcomes of crises.
    Our main conclusion is that although there is seemingly endless complexity
    in the possible forms that negotiations can take, there is a very simple
    structure to the possible outcomes that can emerge from negotiations. More
    precisely, we show that any outcome of a complex negotiation procedure
    could also be attained by a simple take-it-or-leave-it offer. In this
    sense, the great diversity of potential bargaining structures is an
    illusion. Our results cast doubt on the common supposition that a state is
    better off using a flexible bargaining strategy than an inflexible one. In
    an empirical analysis of international crises, we find that the issuance
    of an ultimatum has no discernible effect on the result of a crisis, in
    line with our theoretical predictions.

    We introduce a new statistical model to estimate the shape of potentially
    nonlinear, multivariate relationships. The estimator can accurately
    estimate nonlinear relationships whose exact functional form is not known
    in advance.  Compared to similar nonparametric estimators, ours is
    computationally efficient and yields easy-to-interpret results.

    We introduce a new statistical model to estimate the shape of potentially
    nonlinear, multivariate relationships. The method is built on basis
    regression, in which simple functions like polynomials are combined to
    approximate more complex relationships. To reduce the instability
    typically associated with basis regression, we use penalized regression
    techniques that perform automatic model selection, eliminating many terms
    from the final estimate. We focus on methods that satisfy the oracle
    property, which guarantees that terms with no true effect on the outcome
    are excluded from the estimated model in sufficiently large
    samples. Finally, we calculate standard errors and other estimates of
    variability via the bootstrap. In a series of simulations, we show that
    our method can accurately estimate nonlinear relationships, even if the
    exact functional form is not known in advance. We apply our method to
    Gartzke's (2007) data on the "capitalist peace" and find that joint
    democracy and trade dependence may increase the chance of conflict in some
    cases, contrary to the original results.

    The standard practice when estimating a treatment effect is to include all
    available pre-treatment variables in the propensity score.  We
    demonstrate that this approach is not always optimal when the goal is bias
    reduction.

    The standard practice when estimating a treatment effect is to include all
    available pre-treatment variables in the propensity score, and we
    demonstrate that this approach is not always optimal when the goal is bias
    reduction. We characterize the conditions under which including an
    additional relevant variable in the propensity score increases the bias on
    the effect of interest across a variety of different implementations of
    the propensity score methodology. Moreover, we find that balance tests and
    sensitivity analysis provide limited protection against overadjustment.
