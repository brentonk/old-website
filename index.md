Hello!  I am an Assistant Professor in the
[Department of Political Science](http://www.vanderbilt.edu/political-science/)
at Vanderbilt University.  I received my Ph.D. in political science from the
University of Rochester in 2014.

My research spans the areas of international relations, formal modeling, and
statistical methodology.  My CV is available
[in PDF format](data/kenkel_cv.pdf), and my working papers can be viewed on my
[research page](research.html).  Many of my research projects, statistical
software packages, and course materials can be found
[on GitHub](https://github.com/brentonk).

I can be reached via email at `brenton.kenkel@vanderbilt.edu`.
