Hello!  I am currently a fellow in the
[Program for Quantitative and Analytical Political Science](http://q-aps.princeton.edu)
in the [Department of Politics](http://www.princeton.edu/politics) at
Princeton University.  I am also a Ph.D. candidate in the
[Department of Political Science](http://www.rochester.edu/college/psc) at the
University of Rochester.  In the fall of 2014, I will be joining the
[Department of Political Science at Vanderbilt University](http://www.vanderbilt.edu/political-science)
as an Assistant Professor.

My research spans the areas of international relations, formal modeling, and
statistical methodology.  My CV is available
[in PDF format](data/kenkel_cv.pdf), and my working papers can be viewed on my
[research page](research.html).  Many of my research projects, statistical
software packages, and course materials can be found
[on Github](https://github.com/brentonk).

I can be reached via email at `bkenkel<at>princeton.edu`.
