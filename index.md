Hello!  I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Political Science](http://www.vanderbilt.edu/political-science/) at Vanderbilt University.  In the 2017â€“2018 academic year, I am a visitor at the [Wallis Institute of Political Economy](http://www.wallis.rochester.edu/) at the University of Rochester.  I received my Ph.D. in political science from the University of Rochester in 2014.

My research focuses on the political economy of conflict and diplomacy.  My CV is available [here](cv.html), and my working papers can be viewed on my [research page](research.html).  Many of my research projects, statistical software packages, and course materials can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/brentonk).

I can be reached via email at `brenton.kenkel@vanderbilt.edu`.
